Scene 7: Frames to Video prompt

Convert this into video with below prompt
To visually contrast two parental decisions during college admissions—one guided by merit and perseverance, the other by privilege and financial power—without judgment, letting the audience reflect on choice and consequence.

Two college admission environments shown side by side on a single 16:9 screen:

Left frame: Government or merit-based university admission office

Right frame: Private, high-end university admission office

Both scenes happen simultaneously in parallel time.
The boys and their fathers during the admission process.
Primary focus is on the fathers making decisions and the boys observing silently.
Split-screen composition (50/50 vertical split)

Left (Boy 1 – Merit):
Medium-wide shot of father and son standing in a queue or at a simple desk, submitting documents

Right (Boy 2 – Donation):
Medium-wide shot of father and son seated across a polished desk, discussing payment

Camera remains static and balanced to emphasize comparison and equality of framing.
Both actions unfold in real-time parallel motion.
Subtle synchronized gestures (document handover vs cheque/payment confirmation) reinforce contrast without cuts.
Left frame: Neutral to warm lighting, natural daylight, soft shadows

Right frame: Bright, cool, premium lighting, evenly lit interiors
Lighting contrast supports narrative but avoids exaggeration.

Quiet pride and humility on the merit side
Calm confidence and authority on the donation side
Boys show mixed emotions—acceptance, silence, contemplation
Overall feeling: reflective, thoughtful, grounded.

Slow, deliberate pacing.
Allow actions to complete fully in both frames without rushing.
No dramatic beats—let realism carry the weight.

Avoid villainizing either father
Avoid exaggerated wealth or hardship
Avoid fast cuts or camera movement
Avoid text overlays or moral statements
Let visuals speak, not commentary

End the scene with both frames holding for a moment:
Left: receipt stamped
Right: payment acknowledged
Then fade both simultaneously.

Scene 8: Frames to video Prompt

Create a video with the below prompt under 16:9 aspect ratio

To show that despite different paths and privileges, merit leads both boys to the same achievement—graduation and entry into a global tech company—highlighting dignity, pride, and shared success.

Two timelines shown side by side on a single 16:9 screen:
Phase 1: College graduation ceremony
Phase 2: First day at Amazon office
Left side represents the village boy’s journey, right side the city boy’s journey.

The boys are the heroes.
Parents appear as supporting characters during graduation; the boys alone dominate the office scene.

Split-screen vertical layout (50/50):
Phase 1 – Graduation (first half of the video):
Medium-wide shot
Boys in graduation attire standing with parents
Parents slightly behind, hands on shoulders
Camera at chest level, steady and respectful

Phase 2 – Amazon Office (second half of the video):
Low-angle medium-wide shot
Boys standing alone in front of the same Amazon building
Camera slowly tilts upward following their gaze
No camera movement between left and right frames to maintain parity.

Smooth transition from graduation day → next morning (first day of office)
Both sides transition simultaneously to maintain parallel storytelling

No flashbacks or time jumps beyond this single progression
Graduation: Warm daylight, celebratory, soft highlights
Amazon office: Bright morning light, crisp shadows, clean reflections
Lighting is consistent across both frames, with slight attire-based contrast only.

Graduation: Pride, relief, fulfillment, parental joy
Office scene: Hope, ambition, quiet confidence, awe
Overall emotion: “We made it.”

Moderate and steady.
Let smiles linger during graduation photos.
Pause briefly as both boys look up at the Amazon building to let the moment breathe.
Avoid showing company interiors or logos too prominently
Avoid exaggerating wealth or background differences
Avoid dramatic music cues or fast cuts
Avoid text overlays, titles, or moral statements

Scene 9: Frames to Video prompt

Create a video in a 16:9 aspect ratio

To reveal that despite different backgrounds and paths, both boys share not only the same destination but also the same identity—symbolizing equality, shared destiny, and human connection beyond circumstance.

Outside the Amazon office building entrance, moments after their first-day arrival, in a calm corporate campus environment.

Both boys together.
Their expressions, handshake, and spoken names are the emotional core of the scene.

Camera – How it’s seen
Medium shot, eye-level camera
Both boys facing each other, centered in frame
Amazon building softly blurred in the background
Camera remains steady, no movement

Present moment, real-time
Short pause before dialogue
Dialogue exchange happens slowly and clearly

Ends with a gentle fade to white
Light – Visual rules
Soft daylight, evenly lighting both faces
No harsh shadows

As the handshake completes, brightness subtly increases, transitioning into a full white screen

Emotions – What to feel
Warm surprise
Shared joy
Human connection

Quiet realization
Audience should feel a soft smile, not a dramatic shock.

Slow and intentional.
Allow pauses between smiles, dialogue, and handshake.
Fade-out happens gradually, not abruptly.

Avoid background noise overpowering dialogue
Avoid dramatic music swell
Avoid zooms or camera shake
Avoid on-screen text or subtitles
Avoid logos dominating the frame

Dialogue (Natural, Minimal)
Village Boy (smiling):
“En per Yalhan.”
City Boy (pleasantly surprised, smiling wider):
“My name is also Yalhan.”
They shake hands.


Finally all the scenes are combined using Clipchamp with few transitions and message.
